\section{Features}
The \core module is a masked hardware implementation of the AES-128 encryption
algorithm as specified in \cite{nist197}. 

\begin{itemize}
\item{The core implements the AES-128 encrypt function.}
\item{The implementation is protected against side-channel attacks using a combination of HPC1~\cite{DBLP:journals/tc/CassiersGLS21} and HPC3~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/Knichel022} masking scheme.}
\item{The amount of shares $d\ge 2$ can be chosen at synthesis time.\footnote{While feasible, the architecture of the S-box is optimised and automatically generated for a given amount of shares. Therefore, changing the amount of share without re-generating the S-box may lead to suboptimal results. See~\ref{section:masked_aes_core_arhcitecture} for more details.}}
\item{The randomness required for the masking scheme is internally generated using an embedded PRNG.}
\item{The core is controlled through three simple valid-ready stream interfaces (input data/key, output data and PRNG seed.}
\item{The core has an encryption latency of 86~clock cycles and a throughput of one 128-bit block of data per 86~clock cycles.}
\item{There is no latency penalty for key change.}
\item{The state of the core is automatically cleared when encryption finishes.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Core User Guide} 
\label{section:svrs_usage}

A top-level view of the core is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:top_module_view} and a detailed list of the ports is given in
Table~\ref{table:ports}.
The interface is composed of three independent interfaces: the input
composed of the plaintext and the key (in red), the ciphertext output (in blue)
and the PRNG seed (in green).
The key (\svrsKey), plaintext (\svrsPlaintext) and ciphertext (\svrsCiphertext)
are all 128-bit masked values.
The internal PRNG seed (\svrsSeed) is 80-bit wide.

    \label{fig:seq_svrs}
\end{figure}

The Synchronous Valid-Ready Stream (SVRS) protocol operates between a sender and a receiver.
The bus is composed of the two control signals \texttt{valid} and \texttt{ready}, as well as any number of \texttt{data} wires.
The \texttt{valid} and \texttt{data} signals are outputs (resp. inputs) of the
sender (resp. receiver), while the \texttt{ready} signal is an input (resp.
output) of the sender (resp. receiver).

The bus operates synchronously with an event source shared by the sender and
the receiver (here, the positive edges of the clock).
At each event, a transaction occurs if both \texttt{valid} and \texttt{ready}
are asserted (i.e. set to logical~1). The transmitted data of the transaction is
the value of the \texttt{data} signals at the event.

Once \texttt{valid} is asserted, it cannot be de-asserted (i.e., sticky signal), nor can the value of
\texttt{data} be changed until a transaction occurs.
To prevent deadlocks, a sender must not wait until the assertion of
\texttt{ready} before asserting \texttt{valid}.
To prevent combinational logic loops, the \texttt{valid} signal may not
combinationally depend on the \texttt{ready} signal.

Examples of protocol use are given in Figures~\ref{fig:basic_svrs} and~\ref{fig:seq_svrs}.


\subsection{Core Usage}

\paragraph{Encryption}
An encryption is started by executing a transaction on the \texttt{in} interface.
The encryption is executed using the shared key and plaintext provided in the
transaction, then the \texttt{out} interface becomes valid, with the shared
ciphertext as data.

The core can only perform one execution at a time and will not start a new
encryption before the ciphertext of the current encryption has been consumed from
the \texttt{out} interface.
Figure~\ref{fig:ex2runs} illustrates the interface signal for two consecutive encryptions.

\emph{Security:}
The $\svrsCiphertext$ is gated to not expose any confidential value when
$\svrsOutValid$ is not asserted.

\emph{Initialization:}
After reset, the core will not start an encryption before it is reseeded.

\emph{Latency and throughput:}
The AES implementation has a latency of 86~clock cycles. To achieve the
maximum throughput of one encrypted block per 86~cycles, there must be no
back-pressure (i.e., $\portAESOutReady$ must be high at the clock cycle where
$\portAESOutValid$ becomes asserted) and the input must be valid
($\portAESInValid$ asserted) at least one cycle before $\portAESOutValid$ is
asserted.

    \caption{Exemplary interface view for two executions.}
    \label{fig:ex2runs}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{(Re-)seeding}

The \texttt{seed} interface is used to reseed the internal PRNG (this
PRNG generates the internal masking randomness, see
Section~\ref{subsection:PRNG} for details).
A reseed is executed by means of a transaction on the \texttt{seed} interface,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exreseed}.
During this transaction, the provided seed data \texttt{must} be uniform
randomness (i.e. all the bits must be fresh, uniform and independent).
After a reseed transaction, the reseeding procedure lasts for a few cycles (the
duration depends on the core configuration, it is typically less than a dozen
cycles). 

\emph{Interactions with encryption.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item After a reset, the core does not start any encryption before being reseeded once.
    \item The core will not accept a reseed transaction while it is encrypting.
    \item The core will not start an encryption while it is reseeding.
    \item Starting a new encryption takes precedence over starting a reseed,
        hence if reseeding if needed, no new valid input should be asserted
        before a reseed transaction happens.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sharing encoding}
\label{sec:share_encoding}

The busses $\svrsPlaintext$, $\svrsKey$ and
$\svrsCiphertext$ contain respectively the shared representation of the
plaintext, the key and the ciphertext.

A sharing (or shared representation) of a bit $b$ is a tuple of $d$ shares
$\left(b^0, b^1, \dots, b^{d-1} \right)$ such that $\bigoplus_{m,0\leq m<d} b^m = b$.
The sharing of a $n$-bit bus
$\texttt{data}\left[ n-1:0\right]$ where $\texttt{data}[i]=b_i$
is
$\texttt{shares\_data}\left[ nd-1:0 \right]$ where
$\texttt{shares\_data}\left[ ni+j\right] = b_i^j$ and
$\left(b_i^0, \dots, b_i^{d-1}\right)$ is a sharing of $b_i$.
This representation is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:encoding}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \input{figures/tikz_bus_encoding}
        \end{tikzpicture}
    }
    \caption{Encoding of a shared $n$-bit wide data with $d$ shares.}
    \label{fig:encoding}
\end{figure}

The key and the plaintext must be fed as uniform sharings (i.e. the sharing is
selected uniformly at random among possible sharings that represent the correct
value). The output ciphertext sharing is guaranteed to be uniform.

\section{Core Architecture}
\label{section:architecture}

The top-level architecture of $\topName$ is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:top_module_view}:
its main components are the encryption unit $\topModAES$ and the PRNG. Some additional logic
is used to handle the encrypt/reseed interlocking, as well as units to shuffle
the shares of the masked busses.

\paragraph{Core}
The module $\topModAES$ implements a masked version of the AES encryption
algorithm by serially processing 32-bits parts of the state. It runs a single
AES execution at a time and the ciphertext produced ($\portAESOutCipher$) has
to be fetched before a new execution can start.
The shared plaintext ($\portAESInPlaintext$) and the shared
key ($\portAESInKey$) are fetched at the beginning of a new execution by
performing a simple transaction at the input interface (with
$\portAESInValid$ and $\portAESInReady$).
Similarly, the shared ciphertext ($\portAESOutCipher$) is output from the core
with a dedicated interface (with $\portAESOutValid$ and
$\portAESOutReady$). The signal $\portAESbusy$ is asserted when 
an execution is ongoing inside the core.

\paragraph{PRNG}
The module $\topModPRNG$ is generating the randomness required by the 
masking scheme. It is the producer on the randomness bus, while $\topModAES$ is
the receiver.

When not reseeding, it takes only a single cycle to generate the fresh randomness, therefore
at the next cycle after a randomness transaction, new randomness is already available (i.e.,
$\portAESRnd$ carries fresh randomness, and $\portPrngOutValid$ is asserted).
During an encryption, $\topModAES$ needs randomness at all clock cycles, hence
it keeps $\portPrngOutReady$ asserted, and thanks to the high-throughput
capability of the PRNG, a transaction happens on the randomness bus at every
clock cycles ($\portPrngOutValid$ stays asserted).

This high throughput capability is actually relied upon by $\topModAES$: it
needs randomness for security at every cycle during the encryption
and cannot stall once encryption is started.
The signal $\portPrngOutValid$ is de-asserted only when the PRNG has not been
seeded after a reset, or while it is reseeding.
To ensure that fresh randomness is always available when encrypting, the
interlocking logic prevents the $\topModAES$ from starting an encryption if
$\portPrngOutValid$ is de-asserted, while it prevents $\topModPRNG$ from
starting a reseed when an encryption is ongoing.
If no encryption is ongoing and $\svrsSeedValid$ is asserted, then a reseed is
initiated and a transaction on the \texttt{seed} bus occurs at the next cycle
(this is to avoid a combinational dependency $\svrsSeedValid \rightarrow
\svrsSeedReady$, and is achieved by detecting a rising edge on the PRNG
$\portPrngBusy$ signal).

\paragraph{Share shuffling}
The modules $\texttt{shares2shbus}$ and $\texttt{shbus2shares}$ are simple wire
shufflings that ``transpose'' the encoding of the shared data.
More precisely, the encoding of a sharing inside $\topModAES$
is $\texttt{shares\_data\_inner}\left[ ni+j\right] = b_j^i$ unlike the more
intuitive external representation $\texttt{shares\_data}\left[ ni+j\right] =
b_i^j$ described in Section~\ref{sec:share_encoding}.
This internal representation is more convenient for the implementation, as it
makes it easier to describe the extraction of masked bits from a masked bus
using Verilog operators.

\subsection{Masked AES Core Architecture} 
\label{section:masked_aes_core_arhcitecture}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \input{figures/tikz_aes_glob_arch}
        \end{tikzpicture}
    }
    \caption{Datapath architecture of the module \topModAES. Wires not in bold are $32d$ bits wide (apart from muxes control signals).}
    \label{fig:aes_glob_arch}
\end{figure}

The module $\topModAES$ is almost identical to the 32-bit masked AES
implementation presented in~\cite{DBLP:conf/cosade/MominCS22}. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:aes_glob_arch}, the module is organized around two datapath
blocks performing the operations dedicated to the round computation (denoted
\modAESdpState) and the key scheduling (denoted $\modAESdpKey$). The module
$\modAESsbox$ is shared between the two datapath blocks and implements the
$\SB$ layer for 4 masked bytes. In particular, it is composed of 4~parallel
instances of masked S-boxes that follow an optimized architecture based on the
S-box implementation presented in~\cite{DBLP:journals/tches/CassiersGMMN24}
that relies on the representation presented in~\cite{DBLP:conf/ches/Canright05}.

The S-boxes have been generated using COMPRESS, and are thus optimised for a
given amount of shares. The amount of shares implemented in a practical
integration can be modified at synthesis time by changing the generic $d$ at
the top level. However, a mismatch between the amount of shares instanciated
and the amount of shares specified during the S-box generation with COMPRESS
may lead to sub-optimal performance (e.g., area and/or latency). In this
document, we report the results for four different protection levels, namely
$d\in[2,3,4,5]$. When another amount of shares is required, it is advised to
generate an optimal S-box implementation using COMPRESS\footnote{Please refer
    to
    \href{https://github.com/cassiersg/compress_artifact}{https://github.com/cassiersg/compress\_artifact}
for more info}.  A single S-box is organized as a pipeline of 4 stages that
requires 36 random bits (resp. 96, 192 and 300) per execution considering $d=2$
(resp. 3, 4 and 5). The bus $\portAESRnd$ is used to provide the fresh
randomness to the 4~S-boxes instances (randomness is not used anywhere else in
$\topModAES$).

\subsection{Architecture of the $\modAESdpState$ module}
\label{sec:architecture}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \input{figures/tikz_dpState}
        \end{tikzpicture}
    }
    \caption{Global architecture of the \modAESdpState module. The value held by the DFF at index $i$ is depicted by the signal $\dpStateDFF{i}$ in the HDL.}
    \label{fig:aes_dpState}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:aes_dpState} shows the detailed architecture of the
module $\modAESdpState$. It is organized as a shift register where each
register unit holds a masked state byte (the numbers on the figure
indicate the byte index in the unmasked state).
The module operates on 32-bit parts of the state and is also implementing the
logic that computes the $\AK$, $\SR$ and $\MC$ layers.
In particular, these are implemented in purely
combinational logic.
Addition gadgets (i.e., XORs) are used to perform the key addition with key
bytes coming from the round
key (denoted $\AESdpStateFromKey$).
The module $\dpStateModMC$ computes the
result of the $\MC$ operation for a masked column (i.e., 4~masked bytes). The
$\SR$ layer is free, being implemented as a specific
routing at the input of the $\SB$ layer.
In particular, the ordering of the bytes routed to the
S-boxes (denoted $\AESdpStateToSB$) is selected such that the rotations over
the rows are applied. Dedicated MUXes (controlled by $\dpStateCtrlRouteMC$) are
used in order to bypass the $\MC$ logic block when executing the last round.
Other MUXes (controlled by $\dpStateCtrlRouteLoop$) are used during the
last key addition in order to bypass the $\SR$, $\SB$ and $\MC$ layers.
When a new execution starts, the masked plaintext bytes are loaded in the register through the 
MUXes controlled by $\dpStateCtrlRouteIn$.
Then, the $\AK$ and $\SR$ layers are executed by propagating the data 
across the pipeline to the S-boxes.
The $\MC$ operation is performed when the result of the $\SB$ layer is coming back to the 
core by asserting the signal $\dpStateCtrlRouteMC$. 

\subsection{Architecture of the $\modAESdpKey$ module}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \input{figures/tikz_dpKey}
        \end{tikzpicture}
    }
    \caption{Global architecture of the module $\modAESdpKey$. The value held by the DFF at index $i$ is depicted by the signal $\dpKeyDFF{i}$ in the HDL.}
    \label{fig:aes_dpKey}
\end{figure}

The module $\modAESdpKey$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:aes_dpKey}. It is
organized as a shift register where each register unit holds a masked byte of
the key. The module is split in 4~independent parts, each taking care of the
key scheduling operation on a single row. The sharing of the 128-bit key is
routed from the input with the control signal $\dpKeyCtrlInit$. Two relevant
bytes ordering are depicted on the Figure and both refers to the byte index in
the unmasked key. First, the number on the top depict the byte ordering at the
beginning of a round when the key addition occurs. Second, the bottom number
(between parentheses) depict the byte ordering when a fresh execution starts,
at the last cycle of a round or when the $\SB$ layer results of the key
scheduling are fetch back from the S-boxes, as detailed next. In practice, the
second ordering corresponds to the first one with a rotation of 1 column to the
left.

Concretely, the key scheduling starts by sending the last column of the key
(i.e., byte indexes 12, 13, 14 and 15) to the S-boxes.  The $\texttt{RotWord}$
operation is performed by the routing that sends the key bytes to the S-boxes.
Once computed, the result of the $\SB$ layer is routed back to the core through
the MUX controlled by the signal $\dpKeyCtrlRouteFromSB$.  At the same time,
the round constant is applied and the first column (i.e., byte indexes 0,1,2
and 3) of the new key is computed by adding its value to the column coming back
from the S-boxes.  The remaining three columns (i.e., byte indexes [4,5,6,7],
[8,9,10,11] and [12,13,14,15] are then updated sequentially by XORing each
bytes with the value of the last byte updated in the same row. The signal
$\dpKeyCtrlLoop$ is used to make the key shares loop across the key pipeline.
This is required to keep the key material after the $\AK$ operations while the
$\SB$ results of the key scheduling is still under computation. 

\subsection{Internal operation}

Let us first introduce notations for the intermediate states in the AES algorithm with
pseudo-code in Figure~\ref{fig:code_round} and Figure~\ref{fig:code_key}.
Each variable denotes a state or subkey byte at a given step of the algorithm.
In particular, the plaintext (resp. key, ciphertext) byte at index $0\leq i<16$
is denoted \pP{i} (resp. $\pK{i}$, $\pCt{i}$), and the value $\pS{i}{r}$ (resp.
$\pRK{i}{r}$) denotes the byte at index $i$ of the state (resp. round key)
starting the $r$-th round.
When no index is given, the full 128-bit state is considered instead.

    \label{fig:time_first_round}
\end{figure}

Using these notations, Figures~\ref{fig:pipe_sbox}, \ref{fig:pipe_dpkey}
and~\ref{fig:pipe_dpstate} describe the evolution of the AES states stored in
the architecture over the computation of one round.
Next, Figures~\ref{fig:time_first_round}, \ref{fig:time_regime}
and~\ref{fig:time_last_round} depict the control signals that drive the
datapath for the first round, middle rounds, and last round.
In particular, for the first round (Figure~\ref{fig:time_first_round}), the
data is fetched by the module when the signal $\portAESInValid$ is asserted if
the core is not busy, there is no ciphertext stored in the core and randomness
is available.
At the next clock cycle, the
internal FSM counters $\timeCnrRound$ and $\timeCnrCycle$ are reset and the
execution begins. The round function and the key scheduling algorithm are
executed in parallel by interleaving the S-boxes usage appropriately. In
particular, the first cycle of the execution is used to start the key
scheduling algorithm by asserting $\AESsboxFeedKey$ and $\AESsboxValidIn$.
During this cycle, the module $\modAESdpKey$ is enabled and the
$\dpKeyCtrlLoop$ (rotating then the columns), while the module $\modAESdpState$
is disabled.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{figures/tikz_time_regime} 
    \caption{In regime data routing.}
    \label{fig:time_regime}
\end{figure}


Then, the core enters into a nominal regime that computes a round in 8~cycles,
as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:time_regime}.  A typical round starts with
4~clock cycles during which data is read from the state registers, XORed with
the subkey and fed to the S-boxes, which performs the $\AK$, $\SR$ and $\SB$
layers for the full state (one column per cycle).  During these cycles,
$\AESsboxValidIn$ is asserted and data (state and subkey) loops over the shift
registers. An exception occurs at the fourth cycle (i.e., when
$\timeCnrCycle=3$): at this cycle, the S-boxes output the column of the new
subkey value, which is processed by deasserting $\dpKeyCtrlLoop$.  Next, during
the last 4~cycles of a round, the S-boxes output the 4~columns of the state, on
which the $\MC$ layer is directly applied, and the result is stored in the
state registers. At the same time, the subkey update is finalized, such that a
new subkey is ready at the last cycle of a round (i.e., $\timeCnrCycle=7$).
During this last cycle, the next key schedule round is started, and a new state
round starts at the following cycle.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{figures/tikz_time_last_round} 
    \caption{Data routing during last rounds.}
    \label{fig:time_last_round}
\end{figure}

Finally, the last round is very similar to the regime mode except that the
module $\dpStateModMC$ is bypassed. In particular, the signal
$\dpStateCtrlRouteMC$ is de-asserted and the shift registers are configured to
make the data loop. No new key scheduling round is started during this last
cycle.
At the end of the last round, once the ciphertext has been fetched from the
output, a new encryption starts immediately (if $\portAESInValid$ is asserted),
or the state register is cleared by asserting the control signal
$\dpStateCtrlRouteIn$.
This ensures that the core is completely clear of any key- or
plaintext-dependent data.

    }
    \caption{Datapath Architecture of a unrolled Trivium module}
    \label{fig:prng}
\end{figure}


\label{subsection:PRNG}

The module $\topModPRNG$ is a PRNG generating all the pseudo-random bits
required by the S-boxes in a single clock cycle, denoted next \NRNDBITS.
Following the recommendation from~\cite{CiC-1-2-4}, it is based on one or
multiple instances of the Trivium stream
cipher~\cite{DBLP:series/lncs/CanniereP08} from which the key stream is used as
the PRNG output. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prng}, a Trivium instance is
implemented using a 288-bit state register and $\UNROLL$ cascaded combinational
layers that each implement one state update step and produce one keystream bit.
Moreover, the state register is either taken from a reseed value (to initiate a
reseed), or from the output of the final update step (during normal operation).
At the output, the keystream is stored in a register to avoid the propagation
of glitches that could reduce the security of the masked circuit.

The use of multiple Trivium instances allows us to adjust the area-latency
trade-off: with more Trivium instances, $\UNROLL$ can be reduced, leading to a
lower combinational logic depth.  The top-level $\MAXUNROLL$ parameter is used
for this purpose: the number of instances is $\NTRIVIUMS = \lceil \NRNDBITS /
\MAXUNROLL \rceil$, and $\UNROLL = \lceil \NRNDBITS / \NTRIVIUMS \rceil$, which
ensures that $\UNROLL \le \MAXUNROLL$.

The reseeding follows the initialization of Trivium. Concretely, the state is
first set to
$\texttt{1}^3|\texttt{0}^{112}|\texttt{IV}|\texttt{0}^{13}|\texttt{KEY}$, where
the \texttt{KEY} is set to the 80-bit externally provided seed (it is
the same for all Trivium instances), while the \texttt{IV} is a constant, which
is distinct for each Trivium instance.  Then, the update function is applied at
least $4\cdot 288$ times, i.e., the PRNG is executed while feeding back its
state for $4\cdot 288 / \UNROLL$ cycles.  During the reseed, the signal
$\portPrngBusy$ is asserted and $\portPrngOutValid$ is not. Once finished, the
signal $\portPrngOutValid$ is asserted.  After a reset, the core requires will
not output valid data (i.e., $\portPrngOutValid$ will stay de-asserted) until
the completion of a reseed.

\section{Core Verification}
\label{section:verif}
\paragraph{Functionality}
In order to ensure the proper functionality of the AES core, the Known-Answer
Tests of the NIST ``Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithm Validation List'' is
verified with the provided
testbench\footnote{https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/block-ciphers}.

In particular, all the testvectors related to the
encryption algorithm from the files \texttt{ECBGFSbox128.rsp},
\texttt{ECBKeySbox128.rsp}, \texttt{ECBVarKey128.rsp} and
\texttt{ECBVarTxt128.rsp} are tested at the RTL level. The
testbench follows a randomized regression testing strategy to assess the
functionality of the module. In particular, the execution related to each
testvector cases is started sequentially by performing a transaction
at the input interface.  To simulate the behavior that may happen due to the
integration of the core in a more complex system, a random amount of clock
cycles is waited before initializing a transaction (i.e., before asserting the
$\svrsInValid$ signal). Similarly, in order to simulate (hard) back-pressure conditions that may occur
in practice, the output interface is simulated with random
assertion of the $\svrsOutReady$ signal. Besides, in
parallel to the behavioral known-answer tests, the reseeding procedure is
tested by issuing reseed requests at regular interval. This is achieved by 
waiting a random amount of clock cycles before asserting the signal
$\svrsSeedValid$ and waiting until a transaction at the seed interface occurs.

Additionally, a practical implementation on an Artix7 FPGA (xc7a100tftg256-2)
has been tested with random known-test vectors (i.e., random key, plaintext and seed) for cores below version 1.2 (not included).  

\paragraph{Side-channel security}
This core has been formally verified for security in the glitch+transition
robust probing model using the \texttt{fullVerif}%
tool~\cite{DBLP:journals/tc/CassiersGLS21,DBLP:journals/tches/CassiersS21}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/cassiersg/fullverif}}.
The scripts for this verification are provided along with the implementation.
An implementation of the version 1.0.1 has also been empirically evaluated on
an FPGA (with synthesis optimizations disabled), the evaluation report is
available at \url{https://simple-crypto.org/outputs}. The latter also undergone
a public evaluation in the context of the CHES23
challenge/footnote{https://smaesh-challenge.simple-crypto.org/}. Note that this
evaluation is device-specific, and should be performed on every instantiation
of this device.
